# frontend boilerplate

This is my starter project for most projects to save time on the initial setup.

## What's here?
I'm aiming for end-to-end type safety here with a REST api thanks to `openapi-fetch`.
All components from shadcn-svelte are installed.

- `sveltekit`
- `@tanstack/svelte-query` for better data fetching
- `@tanstack/svelte-query-devtools` for debuging
- `openapi-fetch` for amazing type safety from rest-api
- `shadcn-svelte` for nice components
- `tailwindcss` for styling
- `unplugin-icons` for best icons out there
- `vitest` for testing 
- `@sinclair/typebox` for validation
- `mode-watcher` for darkmode
- `sveltekit-superforms` for form handling
- `tailwind-merge` as utility helper
- `svelte-legos` as ultility
- `formsnap` as helper for shadcn and superforms

Basic configuration of everything + simple layout with hideable menu (app shell) + auth.
